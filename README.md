**Kafka:**

When Kafka consumes the same event twice but with a different offset, even though the event ID and partition ID are the same, several possible issues might be at play:

### 1. **Duplicate Event Production**
   - The producer might be sending the same event multiple times. If a producer experiences retries or network issues, it may accidentally produce the same event more than once. In such cases, the event would have different offsets but identical IDs and partition data.

### 2. **Consumer Offset Management Issue**
   - **Improper Offset Committing**: If the consumer fails to commit offsets properly (e.g., commits the offset after processing instead of before), it could reprocess events after a restart, resulting in duplicate consumption of the same event.
   - **Rebalancing Issues**: If a Kafka consumer group experiences rebalancing due to a crash or other issue, consumers might re-read events that were previously processed, depending on how offsets are managed.
   - **Auto Offset Reset**: If `auto.offset.reset` is set to `earliest`, a consumer might reprocess old messages from the earliest offset rather than continuing from the latest.

### 3. **At-Least-Once Semantics**
   - Kafka provides **at-least-once** delivery semantics by default. This means that an event can be delivered more than once under certain conditions, like consumer restarts, network retries, or failure scenarios. However, these messages will have different offsets since Kafka guarantees ordered delivery but not uniqueness per consumption.

### 4. **Partition Rebalancing or Topic Compaction**
   - **Partition Rebalancing**: If partitions are being reassigned or rebalanced among consumers, there might be some messages replayed during the transition.
   - **Topic Compaction**: Kafka topics can be configured to compact data by key, which could lead to situations where older events are kept in the log but the offsets are updated when compaction occurs. However, this should generally not result in duplicated consumption unless the consumer is misconfigured.

### 5. **Message Redelivery due to Consumer Failure**
   - If the consumer crashed after processing but before committing the offset, Kafka would resend the last uncommitted message after recovery. This scenario would lead to reprocessing the same message with a new offset.

### 6. **Message Deduplication Failure**
   - If the system is meant to deduplicate messages by event ID but fails to do so, it may allow the same event to be processed multiple times. Kafka does not enforce message uniqueness by default, so the responsibility for deduplication rests with the application.

---

### How to Troubleshoot:
- **Check producer logs**: Ensure that the producer is not sending duplicate events.
- **Check offset management**: Confirm that your consumer is properly managing offsets and committing them at the right time.
- **Check partition rebalancing**: Look into whether consumer rebalancing occurred, as this can lead to duplicate message consumption.
- **Use Idempotent Consumers**: Ensure that your consumer logic handles duplicate events by checking for unique event IDs.

Would you like more information on Kafka offset handling or help with debugging?
To help debug Kafka offset handling, let’s dive deeper into the mechanics and how you can approach solving duplicate event consumption problems.

### 1. **Understanding Kafka Offsets**
   - **Offset**: Kafka assigns each message a unique **offset** within a partition. Consumers keep track of these offsets to know which messages have been processed.
   - **Committed Offsets**: A Kafka consumer commits offsets to indicate which messages it has processed. These are stored in a Kafka internal topic (`__consumer_offsets`) or an external storage like a database.

### 2. **Common Issues with Offset Management**
   
   **a. Commit Timing Issues**
   - If the consumer commits the offset **after** processing the message, but crashes before the commit, it will re-read the same message on recovery.
   - **Solution**: Commit offsets immediately **after** consuming a batch of messages (before processing). Alternatively, use **manual commits** after processing and ensure they are handled in a transactional manner. Kafka also supports **exactly-once semantics (EOS)** if using transactions.

   **b. Auto-Offset Management**
   - Kafka's `enable.auto.commit` can be misleading. By default, it commits offsets at regular intervals, which could result in offsets not being updated for a while.
   - **Solution**: Disable `enable.auto.commit` and commit offsets manually after successfully processing each message or batch. This gives you control over when an offset is saved and avoids reprocessing already processed messages.

### 3. **Kafka Consumer Group Rebalancing**
   - When a Kafka consumer is part of a **consumer group**, partitions are assigned across all consumers. If a consumer leaves, joins, or crashes, Kafka triggers a **rebalance** where partitions are reassigned.
   - During this rebalancing, messages may be reprocessed by another consumer if the offset is not properly committed.
   - **Solution**: Ensure that offsets are committed before rebalancing. You can also use **Sticky Partitioning** (via `partition.assignment.strategy`) to reduce rebalancing frequency, ensuring more stability in your consumer group.

### 4. **Exactly-Once Semantics (EOS)**
   Kafka offers **exactly-once processing guarantees** through a combination of idempotent producers and transactional consumers:
   
   - **Idempotent Producers**: Kafka producers can be configured to avoid sending duplicate messages even after retries. Set the producer property `enable.idempotence=true`.
   - **Transactional Consumers**: To avoid double processing, transactional consumers ensure that consumption and offset commits are performed atomically using the `read_committed` isolation level.
   - **Solution**: Implement transactional consumers and producers to leverage Kafka's exactly-once semantics if your system requires strict deduplication.

### 5. **Deduplication Strategies**
   If you're experiencing duplicate events, deduplication at the consumer level is a recommended strategy:
   
   - **Event ID-based Deduplication**: Use the event ID (or a unique key) and store it in a database or in-memory cache to avoid processing the same event multiple times.
   - **Kafka Stream Processor**: If using Kafka Streams, it has built-in support for stateful processing with windowed aggregates that can help detect duplicates.

### 6. **Configuring Auto Offset Reset Properly**
   Kafka has an `auto.offset.reset` setting which dictates what happens when there’s no initial offset to read from:
   
   - **earliest**: The consumer reads from the beginning of the partition.
   - **latest**: The consumer starts reading from the latest message.
   
   If your consumer is accidentally reading from the `earliest` offset (e.g., after a crash), it will consume older messages again.
   - **Solution**: Set `auto.offset.reset` to `latest` to avoid consuming old messages unless necessary.

### 7. **Using Kafka’s Offset Monitoring Tools**
   Kafka provides tools to inspect and manage offsets:
   - **kafka-consumer-groups.sh**: Use this tool to check the current committed offsets for each consumer group. It helps you see where consumers are starting and if they’re re-reading messages.

     Example command:
     ```bash
     kafka-consumer-groups.sh --bootstrap-server <kafka-broker> --describe --group <consumer-group>
     ```

   - **Monitoring Commit Lag**: Track lag between where your consumers are in the log and the latest offsets available. Lagging consumers can lead to duplicate reads or unprocessed messages piling up.

### Key Steps to Debug:

1. **Check for Duplicates in Producer Logs**: Verify if the producer is sending the same event multiple times due to retries or failures.
   
2. **Verify Offset Committing**: Ensure that the consumer commits offsets either after processing or transactionally. Check your consumer logs and `__consumer_offsets` to see if offsets are being committed properly.
   
3. **Review Consumer Group Rebalancing Events**: Check if your consumer group is rebalancing frequently, as this can cause offsets to be reset or messages to be reprocessed.

4. **Use Kafka Monitoring Tools**: Inspect your consumer group’s offset progress and any offset lag using Kafka’s built-in tools or third-party monitoring solutions (e.g., Prometheus, Grafana).

Would you like to go deeper into any of these areas, or would you like help with some sample code for handling offsets in Kafka?

Here’s a sample Kafka consumer code in Java that demonstrates manual offset committing, which gives you more control over when the consumer commits the offsets and avoids potential duplicate event processing.

This example will also include how to handle offset committing in a transactional or idempotent way to ensure that even in case of failure, you don’t reprocess events unnecessarily.

### **Kafka Consumer with Manual Offset Commit**

```java
import org.apache.kafka.clients.consumer.ConsumerConfig;
import org.apache.kafka.clients.consumer.ConsumerRecord;
import org.apache.kafka.clients.consumer.KafkaConsumer;
import org.apache.kafka.clients.consumer.ConsumerRecords;

import java.time.Duration;
import java.util.Collections;
import java.util.Properties;

public class KafkaConsumerExample {
    
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        
        // Set up properties for the Kafka consumer
        Properties props = new Properties();
        props.put(ConsumerConfig.BOOTSTRAP_SERVERS_CONFIG, "localhost:9092");
        props.put(ConsumerConfig.GROUP_ID_CONFIG, "my-consumer-group");
        props.put(ConsumerConfig.KEY_DESERIALIZER_CLASS_CONFIG, "org.apache.kafka.common.serialization.StringDeserializer");
        props.put(ConsumerConfig.VALUE_DESERIALIZER_CLASS_CONFIG, "org.apache.kafka.common.serialization.StringDeserializer");
        
        // Disable auto-commit of offsets
        props.put(ConsumerConfig.ENABLE_AUTO_COMMIT_CONFIG, "false");
        
        // Set auto.offset.reset to latest (or earliest if you want to start from the beginning)
        props.put(ConsumerConfig.AUTO_OFFSET_RESET_CONFIG, "latest");
        
        // Create the Kafka consumer
        KafkaConsumer<String, String> consumer = new KafkaConsumer<>(props);
        
        // Subscribe to the topic(s)
        consumer.subscribe(Collections.singletonList("my-topic"));
        
        try {
            while (true) {
                // Poll for new records (this could be done in a batch manner)
                ConsumerRecords<String, String> records = consumer.poll(Duration.ofMillis(100));

                for (ConsumerRecord<String, String> record : records) {
                    // Process each record
                    System.out.printf("Consumed record with key %s and value %s, partition %d, offset %d%n",
                            record.key(), record.value(), record.partition(), record.offset());
                    
                    // Add your event processing logic here
                    processEvent(record);
                    
                    // Manually commit the offset after processing
                    // Commit the offset for this partition and offset
                    consumer.commitSync(Collections.singletonMap(record.partition(), record.offset() + 1));
                }
            }
        } catch (Exception e) {
            e.printStackTrace();
        } finally {
            consumer.close();
        }
    }

    private static void processEvent(ConsumerRecord<String, String> record) {
        // Add your event processing logic here.
        // Ensure that it is idempotent, or check for unique event IDs to prevent duplicate processing.
        System.out.println("Processing event: " + record.value());
    }
}
```

### **Explanation:**
- **Manual Offset Commit (`consumer.commitSync()`)**: After processing each record, we manually commit the offset. This ensures that offsets are only committed once the event has been successfully processed, which avoids losing progress or duplicating events in case of failures.
- **Auto Commit Disabled**: `ENABLE_AUTO_COMMIT_CONFIG` is set to `false` to disable Kafka’s default offset commit behavior.
- **Committing Specific Offsets**: The method `commitSync(Collections.singletonMap(record.partition(), record.offset() + 1))` commits the offset for each partition after processing a message. The `+1` ensures that the next poll will skip the processed message.

### **Kafka Consumer with Transactional Semantics**
If you want to use Kafka’s **exactly-once semantics (EOS)**, here’s a more advanced version using transactions.

First, ensure that your producer and broker are configured for idempotency and transactions.

#### **Consumer Configuration for Exactly-Once Semantics**

```java
props.put(ConsumerConfig.ISOLATION_LEVEL_CONFIG, "read_committed");  // Ensure you only read committed messages
props.put(ConsumerConfig.ENABLE_AUTO_COMMIT_CONFIG, "false");  // Manual offset commit
```

Here’s how you would implement transactions using the Kafka producer and consumer:

```java
import org.apache.kafka.clients.consumer.ConsumerConfig;
import org.apache.kafka.clients.consumer.KafkaConsumer;
import org.apache.kafka.clients.consumer.ConsumerRecords;
import org.apache.kafka.clients.consumer.ConsumerRecord;
import org.apache.kafka.clients.producer.KafkaProducer;
import org.apache.kafka.clients.producer.ProducerConfig;
import org.apache.kafka.clients.producer.ProducerRecord;
import org.apache.kafka.clients.producer.TransactionState;
import java.util.Properties;
import java.time.Duration;
import java.util.Collections;

public class KafkaExactlyOnceConsumer {

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Set consumer properties
        Properties consumerProps = new Properties();
        consumerProps.put(ConsumerConfig.BOOTSTRAP_SERVERS_CONFIG, "localhost:9092");
        consumerProps.put(ConsumerConfig.GROUP_ID_CONFIG, "transactional-consumer-group");
        consumerProps.put(ConsumerConfig.KEY_DESERIALIZER_CLASS_CONFIG, "org.apache.kafka.common.serialization.StringDeserializer");
        consumerProps.put(ConsumerConfig.VALUE_DESERIALIZER_CLASS_CONFIG, "org.apache.kafka.common.serialization.StringDeserializer");
        consumerProps.put(ConsumerConfig.ENABLE_AUTO_COMMIT_CONFIG, "false");
        consumerProps.put(ConsumerConfig.ISOLATION_LEVEL_CONFIG, "read_committed");

        KafkaConsumer<String, String> consumer = new KafkaConsumer<>(consumerProps);
        consumer.subscribe(Collections.singletonList("my-topic"));

        // Set producer properties for exactly-once semantics
        Properties producerProps = new Properties();
        producerProps.put(ProducerConfig.BOOTSTRAP_SERVERS_CONFIG, "localhost:9092");
        producerProps.put(ProducerConfig.KEY_SERIALIZER_CLASS_CONFIG, "org.apache.kafka.common.serialization.StringSerializer");
        producerProps.put(ProducerConfig.VALUE_SERIALIZER_CLASS_CONFIG, "org.apache.kafka.common.serialization.StringSerializer");
        producerProps.put(ProducerConfig.ENABLE_IDEMPOTENCE_CONFIG, "true"); // Idempotent producer
        producerProps.put(ProducerConfig.TRANSACTIONAL_ID_CONFIG, "my-transactional-id"); // Transactional ID for EOS

        KafkaProducer<String, String> producer = new KafkaProducer<>(producerProps);
        producer.initTransactions(); // Initialize the transaction

        try {
            while (true) {
                ConsumerRecords<String, String> records = consumer.poll(Duration.ofMillis(100));

                producer.beginTransaction(); // Begin a transaction
                
                for (ConsumerRecord<String, String> record : records) {
                    // Process the record
                    System.out.printf("Processing record: %s%n", record.value());
                    // Forward the processed message to another topic (example)
                    producer.send(new ProducerRecord<>("output-topic", record.key(), record.value()));
                }

                // Commit the offsets for the consumer group within the transaction
                producer.sendOffsetsToTransaction(consumer.offsetsForTimes(Collections.emptyMap()), "transactional-consumer-group");
                
                producer.commitTransaction(); // Commit the transaction
            }
        } catch (Exception e) {
            producer.abortTransaction(); // In case of failure, abort the transaction
            e.printStackTrace();
        } finally {
            consumer.close();
            producer.close();
        }
    }
}
```

### **Explanation:**
- **Transaction Support**: The `producer.initTransactions()`, `producer.beginTransaction()`, and `producer.commitTransaction()` methods are used to process messages in a transaction.
- **Atomic Offset Commit**: The `sendOffsetsToTransaction()` method ensures that the consumer's offsets are committed within the same transaction, providing exactly-once processing semantics.
- **Transactional ID**: The producer is configured with a unique `transactional.id` to track the transaction.

### Key Takeaways:
1. **Manual Offset Commit**: Provides control to avoid duplicates and ensure offsets are only committed after successful processing.
2. **Transactional Commit**: Guarantees that both the event processing and offset commits are atomic, preventing message reprocessing or loss, even in failure cases.

These examples should give you a solid base to handle offset management effectively. Let me know if you need more details on any part!

# Junits for code coverage:

---
Improving code coverage from 30% to over 90% in an existing Spring Boot 3 project is a significant task, but by following a structured approach, you can achieve it efficiently. Here’s a strategy to help you increase code coverage quickly:

### 1. **Analyze Current Code Coverage**
   - **Use Code Coverage Tools**: Tools like **JaCoCo** (Java Code Coverage) or **SonarQube** will provide detailed reports on which areas of the code are untested. 
   - **Focus on Uncovered Code**: Identify which classes, methods, or lines are lacking coverage. Prioritize critical business logic or areas that have the most complexity or impact on the application's functionality.

### 2. **Focus on Unit Testing First**
   - Unit tests are quicker to write and execute. They also contribute the most to code coverage.
   - **Target Core Business Logic**: Write unit tests for core services, utilities, and any non-trivial methods.
   - **Mock Dependencies**: Use mocking frameworks like **Mockito** to isolate and test components without needing full application context.

### 3. **Increase Integration Testing**
   - Integration tests cover the interaction between components, but they are more time-consuming than unit tests.
   - **Test Layers Together**: Use Spring’s **@SpringBootTest**, **@WebMvcTest**, and **@DataJpaTest** annotations to test the interactions between various layers of your application.
   - **Test REST APIs**: If your application exposes APIs, write tests for them using **MockMvc** or **TestRestTemplate**.

### 4. **Prioritize High-Impact and Frequently Used Code**
   - **Focus on Business-Critical Paths**: Ensure critical services, controllers, and repositories are fully tested.
   - **Edge Cases**: Test edge cases, error scenarios, and boundary conditions. This not only improves code coverage but ensures robustness.
   - **Conditional Branches**: Pay attention to `if`, `else`, `switch`, or loop constructs to make sure all possible paths are covered.

### 5. **Increase Coverage with Parameterized Tests**
   - Use **JUnit 5 Parameterized Tests** to run multiple variations of the same test with different inputs, covering multiple cases efficiently without duplicating code.

   ```java
   @ParameterizedTest
   @ValueSource(strings = {"John", "Jane", "Doe"})
   void testWithDifferentNames(String name) {
       assertTrue(name.length() > 0);
   }
   ```

### 6. **Write Tests for Controllers and Endpoints**
   - **@WebMvcTest**: Use this to test your REST controllers without loading the entire Spring context.
   - Test all request mappings (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE), including happy paths and edge cases (e.g., invalid input, missing parameters).

   ```java
   @WebMvcTest(CustomerController.class)
   class CustomerControllerTest {

       @Autowired
       private MockMvc mockMvc;

       @Test
       void shouldReturnCustomer() throws Exception {
           mockMvc.perform(get("/customers/1"))
                  .andExpect(status().isOk())
                  .andExpect(jsonPath("$.name").value("John Doe"));
       }
   }
   ```

### 7. **Use Mocking to Test Isolated Components**
   - For services that depend on external resources (databases, APIs), use **Mockito** or **Spring's MockBean** to mock dependencies.
   
   ```java
   @MockBean
   private CustomerService customerService;

   @Test
   void shouldReturnCustomerFromService() {
       when(customerService.getCustomerById(1L)).thenReturn(new Customer(1L, "John Doe"));
       Customer customer = customerService.getCustomerById(1L);
       assertEquals("John Doe", customer.getName());
   }
   ```

### 8. **Leverage Test Coverage Reports for Optimization**
   - Use coverage reports from tools like JaCoCo to identify the most critical gaps.
   - For each run, check which methods and classes are still missing tests and prioritize them.
   - Refactor tests if needed to avoid redundancy and optimize coverage efficiency.

### 9. **Add Tests for Exception Handling**
   - Ensure that custom exception handlers or methods with specific exception scenarios are covered.
   - For example, test `@ControllerAdvice` methods that handle exceptions in REST controllers.

### 10. **Automate with CI/CD**
   - Integrate code coverage reporting in your continuous integration pipeline (e.g., with Jenkins, GitHub Actions, etc.) to ensure that new code does not lower the overall coverage.
   - **Fail builds if coverage drops below a certain threshold** to ensure long-term maintenance.

### 11. **Test Private and Utility Methods (if necessary)**
   - Though it’s not recommended to test private methods directly, you can refactor private methods into separate classes (or protected) and then test them.
   - Test **utility classes** (helper methods, constants) that may not have been covered before.

### 12. **Use `@TestConfiguration` for Testing Custom Beans**
   - If you have custom Spring beans (e.g., custom `RestTemplate` configurations or filters), create **@TestConfiguration** classes to ensure those beans are tested in isolation.

### 13. **Leverage In-Memory Databases for Repository Testing**
   - Use **@DataJpaTest** with H2 or other in-memory databases to test repository and persistence logic without relying on a real database.
   - Test repository methods, including CRUD operations and any custom queries.

### 14. **Gradually Improve Tests Over Time**
   - Increasing coverage from 30% to 90% won’t happen overnight. Create a plan to improve coverage gradually while focusing on high-impact areas first.

### Sample Tools:
- **JUnit 5**: For writing unit and integration tests.
- **Mockito**: For mocking dependencies in unit tests.
- **JaCoCo**: For measuring code coverage.
- **SonarQube**: For tracking code quality and coverage metrics.

### Conclusion:
By focusing on unit tests first, testing critical paths, utilizing mocking, and tracking progress using tools like JaCoCo, you can methodically improve code coverage in your Spring Boot project. Prioritize high-value areas, avoid redundant tests, and integrate code coverage into your CI/CD pipeline for long-term success.

When working with Apache Kafka and managing multiple schemas in a local build, it’s common to encounter issues where different schemas redefine common objects differently. Here are some strategies to handle this:

Centralize Common Schemas: If you have objects reused across multiple schemas (e.g., a User object), place these common definitions in a shared schema repository. Use a schema registry (like Confluent’s Schema Registry) to enforce a single version of common objects across all schemas.

Namespace Segmentation: Use namespaces in your schema definitions to prevent name conflicts. Avro, for example, supports namespaces (namespace: "com.example") which helps differentiate similar objects defined across schemas.

Schema Dependencies: Use schema references or imports to keep schemas modular but avoid redundancy. Some schema registry solutions support referencing other schemas as dependencies (e.g., JSON Schema’s $ref or Avro’s imports), making it easier to maintain compatibility with shared definitions.

Schema Versioning: If different schemas have variations of the same object, version them. You could name versions clearly (e.g., UserV1, UserV2) and document where each one is used. This may be helpful when breaking backward compatibility.

Custom Build Logic: In your local build setup, create a build script or CI/CD job to validate that no incompatible definitions exist across schemas. You could use tools like avro-tools or custom validation scripts to check for conflicting definitions and ensure consistent builds.

Schema Registry Client Testing: If using a schema registry, test locally with a Kafka environment that mimics production by using a mock schema registry (e.g., MockSchemaRegistryClient for Confluent). This can help identify conflicts before they go live.

These approaches should help maintain consistency and minimize conflicts in your local builds when dealing with multiple schemas and common objects.

To detect schema conflicts among multiple Avro schemas, you can compare schemas programmatically. Here’s an example of a Python script using the fastavro library to identify conflicting schemas.

This example assumes you have multiple Avro schemas in a directory, and the script will identify conflicts based on shared field names, types, or structures.

```python
First, ensure you have the fastavro library installed:
pip install fastavro
```

Example Script to Find Schema Conflicts
The following script will:

### Load all Avro schema files from a specified directory.
Parse each schema and keep track of shared field definitions.
Detect conflicts when schemas define the same field with different types or structures.

```python

import os
import fastavro
from collections import defaultdict

def load_schemas(schema_dir):
    schemas = {}
    for filename in os.listdir(schema_dir):
        if filename.endswith(".avsc"):
            with open(os.path.join(schema_dir, filename), "r") as file:
                schema = fastavro.schema.load_schema(file)
                schemas[filename] = schema
    return schemas

def check_for_conflicts(schemas):
    field_definitions = defaultdict(list)
    conflicts = []

    # Track field definitions across schemas
    for schema_name, schema in schemas.items():
        for field in schema.get("fields", []):
            field_name = field["name"]
            field_type = field["type"]

            # Store each field definition with its schema name
            field_definitions[field_name].append((schema_name, field_type))

    # Check for conflicts in field definitions
    for field_name, definitions in field_definitions.items():
        unique_types = {str(def_type) for _, def_type in definitions}
        
        if len(unique_types) > 1:
            conflicts.append((field_name, definitions))

    return conflicts

def main():
    schema_dir = "path/to/your/schemas"  # Replace with the directory path containing your .avsc files
    schemas = load_schemas(schema_dir)
    conflicts = check_for_conflicts(schemas)

    if conflicts:
        print("Conflicts detected among schemas:")
        for field_name, definitions in conflicts:
            print(f"\nField '{field_name}' has conflicting definitions:")
            for schema_name, field_type in definitions:
                print(f" - In schema '{schema_name}': {field_type}")
    else:
        print("No conflicts detected among schemas.")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()

```

### Explanation
load_schemas: Loads all .avsc files in the given directory and parses them into Avro schema objects.
check_for_conflicts: Scans each schema for fields with the same name. If multiple definitions are found, it compares their types to identify conflicts.
main: Runs the functions, prints any conflicts found, and specifies which schema files define each conflicting field differently.

### Running the Script
Place this script in a directory with your .avsc files.
Update schema_dir to point to the directory containing your Avro schemas.
Run the script:

```python
   python find_avro_schema_conflicts.py
```

### Output Example
If conflicts are detected, the output will show the conflicting field definitions for easy resolution:

Conflicts detected among schemas:

```python
Field 'userId' has conflicting definitions:
 - In schema 'schema1.avsc': 'string'
 - In schema 'schema2.avsc': 'int'
```

---

To extend the script to support complex type comparisons, we need to handle cases where fields might have nested or array types. For Avro, complex types include records (nested objects), arrays, maps, unions, enums, and fixed-length byte arrays. This updated script will:

Parse schemas as before.
Compare each field's type in detail, even if it’s a complex type.
Report conflicts based on differences in field structures, types, or nested definitions.
Here's an updated version of the script with complex type support:

```python
python
Copy code
import os
import fastavro
from collections import defaultdict

def load_schemas(schema_dir):
    schemas = {}
    for filename in os.listdir(schema_dir):
        if filename.endswith(".avsc"):
            with open(os.path.join(schema_dir, filename), "r") as file:
                schema = fastavro.schema.load_schema(file)
                schemas[filename] = schema
    return schemas

def compare_types(type1, type2):
    """Recursively compare two Avro types, including complex structures."""
    if type(type1) != type(type2):
        return False

    if isinstance(type1, dict) and isinstance(type2, dict):
        if type1.get("type") != type2.get("type"):
            return False
        if type1["type"] == "record":
            # Compare fields in nested records
            fields1 = {field["name"]: field["type"] for field in type1["fields"]}
            fields2 = {field["name"]: field["type"] for field in type2["fields"]}
            return all(
                compare_types(fields1.get(f), fields2.get(f)) for f in fields1.keys() | fields2.keys()
            )
        elif type1["type"] == "array":
            # Compare array item types
            return compare_types(type1["items"], type2["items"])
        elif type1["type"] == "map":
            # Compare map value types
            return compare_types(type1["values"], type2["values"])
        elif type1["type"] == "enum":
            # Compare enums by symbols
            return type1.get("symbols") == type2.get("symbols")
        elif type1["type"] == "fixed":
            # Compare fixed types by size
            return type1.get("size") == type2.get("size")
    
    # For primitive or union types, check for equality
    return type1 == type2

def check_for_conflicts(schemas):
    field_definitions = defaultdict(list)
    conflicts = []

    # Track field definitions across schemas
    for schema_name, schema in schemas.items():
        for field in schema.get("fields", []):
            field_name = field["name"]
            field_type = field["type"]

            # Store each field definition with its schema name
            field_definitions[field_name].append((schema_name, field_type))

    # Check for conflicts in field definitions
    for field_name, definitions in field_definitions.items():
        first_type = definitions[0][1]
        for schema_name, field_type in definitions[1:]:
            if not compare_types(first_type, field_type):
                conflicts.append((field_name, definitions))
                break

Explanation of Complex Type Handling
compare_types Function:

```

Primitive Types: If type1 and type2 are primitive types (like string, int), it simply checks if they are equal.
Records: For nested records, it checks that each field within both records has the same name and type.
Arrays: It ensures both are arrays and that their item types match.
Maps: It ensures both are maps and that their value types match.
Enums: Compares symbols to ensure that the set of allowed values in enums are identical.
Fixed: Compares size to ensure fixed-length byte arrays match.
check_for_conflicts Function:

This function tracks field definitions across schemas.
If two schemas define a field with different types, it uses compare_types to detect structural mismatches, capturing only the genuine conflicts.
Example Output for Conflicts
This script will give detailed output if there’s a conflict, helping you locate and resolve incompatible field definitions:

```python
css
Copy code
Conflicts detected among schemas:

Field 'userData' has conflicting definitions:
 - In schema 'schema1.avsc': {'type': 'record', 'name': 'UserData', 'fields': [{'name': 'userId', 'type': 'string'}]}
 - In schema 'schema2.avsc': {'type': 'record', 'name': 'UserData', 'fields': [{'name': 'userId', 'type': 'int'}]}
This way, you can effectively identify and resolve conflicts, even with complex, nested schemas.
```
