When Kafka consumes the same event twice but with a different offset, even though the event ID and partition ID are the same, several possible issues might be at play:

### 1. **Duplicate Event Production**
   - The producer might be sending the same event multiple times. If a producer experiences retries or network issues, it may accidentally produce the same event more than once. In such cases, the event would have different offsets but identical IDs and partition data.

### 2. **Consumer Offset Management Issue**
   - **Improper Offset Committing**: If the consumer fails to commit offsets properly (e.g., commits the offset after processing instead of before), it could reprocess events after a restart, resulting in duplicate consumption of the same event.
   - **Rebalancing Issues**: If a Kafka consumer group experiences rebalancing due to a crash or other issue, consumers might re-read events that were previously processed, depending on how offsets are managed.
   - **Auto Offset Reset**: If `auto.offset.reset` is set to `earliest`, a consumer might reprocess old messages from the earliest offset rather than continuing from the latest.

### 3. **At-Least-Once Semantics**
   - Kafka provides **at-least-once** delivery semantics by default. This means that an event can be delivered more than once under certain conditions, like consumer restarts, network retries, or failure scenarios. However, these messages will have different offsets since Kafka guarantees ordered delivery but not uniqueness per consumption.

### 4. **Partition Rebalancing or Topic Compaction**
   - **Partition Rebalancing**: If partitions are being reassigned or rebalanced among consumers, there might be some messages replayed during the transition.
   - **Topic Compaction**: Kafka topics can be configured to compact data by key, which could lead to situations where older events are kept in the log but the offsets are updated when compaction occurs. However, this should generally not result in duplicated consumption unless the consumer is misconfigured.

### 5. **Message Redelivery due to Consumer Failure**
   - If the consumer crashed after processing but before committing the offset, Kafka would resend the last uncommitted message after recovery. This scenario would lead to reprocessing the same message with a new offset.

### 6. **Message Deduplication Failure**
   - If the system is meant to deduplicate messages by event ID but fails to do so, it may allow the same event to be processed multiple times. Kafka does not enforce message uniqueness by default, so the responsibility for deduplication rests with the application.

### How to Troubleshoot:
- **Check producer logs**: Ensure that the producer is not sending duplicate events.
- **Check offset management**: Confirm that your consumer is properly managing offsets and committing them at the right time.
- **Check partition rebalancing**: Look into whether consumer rebalancing occurred, as this can lead to duplicate message consumption.
- **Use Idempotent Consumers**: Ensure that your consumer logic handles duplicate events by checking for unique event IDs.

Would you like more information on Kafka offset handling or help with debugging?
To help debug Kafka offset handling, let’s dive deeper into the mechanics and how you can approach solving duplicate event consumption problems.

### 1. **Understanding Kafka Offsets**
   - **Offset**: Kafka assigns each message a unique **offset** within a partition. Consumers keep track of these offsets to know which messages have been processed.
   - **Committed Offsets**: A Kafka consumer commits offsets to indicate which messages it has processed. These are stored in a Kafka internal topic (`__consumer_offsets`) or an external storage like a database.

### 2. **Common Issues with Offset Management**
   
   **a. Commit Timing Issues**
   - If the consumer commits the offset **after** processing the message, but crashes before the commit, it will re-read the same message on recovery.
   - **Solution**: Commit offsets immediately **after** consuming a batch of messages (before processing). Alternatively, use **manual commits** after processing and ensure they are handled in a transactional manner. Kafka also supports **exactly-once semantics (EOS)** if using transactions.

   **b. Auto-Offset Management**
   - Kafka's `enable.auto.commit` can be misleading. By default, it commits offsets at regular intervals, which could result in offsets not being updated for a while.
   - **Solution**: Disable `enable.auto.commit` and commit offsets manually after successfully processing each message or batch. This gives you control over when an offset is saved and avoids reprocessing already processed messages.

### 3. **Kafka Consumer Group Rebalancing**
   - When a Kafka consumer is part of a **consumer group**, partitions are assigned across all consumers. If a consumer leaves, joins, or crashes, Kafka triggers a **rebalance** where partitions are reassigned.
   - During this rebalancing, messages may be reprocessed by another consumer if the offset is not properly committed.
   - **Solution**: Ensure that offsets are committed before rebalancing. You can also use **Sticky Partitioning** (via `partition.assignment.strategy`) to reduce rebalancing frequency, ensuring more stability in your consumer group.

### 4. **Exactly-Once Semantics (EOS)**
   Kafka offers **exactly-once processing guarantees** through a combination of idempotent producers and transactional consumers:
   
   - **Idempotent Producers**: Kafka producers can be configured to avoid sending duplicate messages even after retries. Set the producer property `enable.idempotence=true`.
   - **Transactional Consumers**: To avoid double processing, transactional consumers ensure that consumption and offset commits are performed atomically using the `read_committed` isolation level.
   - **Solution**: Implement transactional consumers and producers to leverage Kafka's exactly-once semantics if your system requires strict deduplication.

### 5. **Deduplication Strategies**
   If you're experiencing duplicate events, deduplication at the consumer level is a recommended strategy:
   
   - **Event ID-based Deduplication**: Use the event ID (or a unique key) and store it in a database or in-memory cache to avoid processing the same event multiple times.
   - **Kafka Stream Processor**: If using Kafka Streams, it has built-in support for stateful processing with windowed aggregates that can help detect duplicates.

### 6. **Configuring Auto Offset Reset Properly**
   Kafka has an `auto.offset.reset` setting which dictates what happens when there’s no initial offset to read from:
   
   - **earliest**: The consumer reads from the beginning of the partition.
   - **latest**: The consumer starts reading from the latest message.
   
   If your consumer is accidentally reading from the `earliest` offset (e.g., after a crash), it will consume older messages again.
   - **Solution**: Set `auto.offset.reset` to `latest` to avoid consuming old messages unless necessary.

### 7. **Using Kafka’s Offset Monitoring Tools**
   Kafka provides tools to inspect and manage offsets:
   - **kafka-consumer-groups.sh**: Use this tool to check the current committed offsets for each consumer group. It helps you see where consumers are starting and if they’re re-reading messages.

     Example command:
     ```bash
     kafka-consumer-groups.sh --bootstrap-server <kafka-broker> --describe --group <consumer-group>
     ```

   - **Monitoring Commit Lag**: Track lag between where your consumers are in the log and the latest offsets available. Lagging consumers can lead to duplicate reads or unprocessed messages piling up.

### Key Steps to Debug:

1. **Check for Duplicates in Producer Logs**: Verify if the producer is sending the same event multiple times due to retries or failures.
   
2. **Verify Offset Committing**: Ensure that the consumer commits offsets either after processing or transactionally. Check your consumer logs and `__consumer_offsets` to see if offsets are being committed properly.
   
3. **Review Consumer Group Rebalancing Events**: Check if your consumer group is rebalancing frequently, as this can cause offsets to be reset or messages to be reprocessed.

4. **Use Kafka Monitoring Tools**: Inspect your consumer group’s offset progress and any offset lag using Kafka’s built-in tools or third-party monitoring solutions (e.g., Prometheus, Grafana).

Would you like to go deeper into any of these areas, or would you like help with some sample code for handling offsets in Kafka?

Here’s a sample Kafka consumer code in Java that demonstrates manual offset committing, which gives you more control over when the consumer commits the offsets and avoids potential duplicate event processing.

This example will also include how to handle offset committing in a transactional or idempotent way to ensure that even in case of failure, you don’t reprocess events unnecessarily.

### **Kafka Consumer with Manual Offset Commit**

```java
import org.apache.kafka.clients.consumer.ConsumerConfig;
import org.apache.kafka.clients.consumer.ConsumerRecord;
import org.apache.kafka.clients.consumer.KafkaConsumer;
import org.apache.kafka.clients.consumer.ConsumerRecords;

import java.time.Duration;
import java.util.Collections;
import java.util.Properties;

public class KafkaConsumerExample {
    
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        
        // Set up properties for the Kafka consumer
        Properties props = new Properties();
        props.put(ConsumerConfig.BOOTSTRAP_SERVERS_CONFIG, "localhost:9092");
        props.put(ConsumerConfig.GROUP_ID_CONFIG, "my-consumer-group");
        props.put(ConsumerConfig.KEY_DESERIALIZER_CLASS_CONFIG, "org.apache.kafka.common.serialization.StringDeserializer");
        props.put(ConsumerConfig.VALUE_DESERIALIZER_CLASS_CONFIG, "org.apache.kafka.common.serialization.StringDeserializer");
        
        // Disable auto-commit of offsets
        props.put(ConsumerConfig.ENABLE_AUTO_COMMIT_CONFIG, "false");
        
        // Set auto.offset.reset to latest (or earliest if you want to start from the beginning)
        props.put(ConsumerConfig.AUTO_OFFSET_RESET_CONFIG, "latest");
        
        // Create the Kafka consumer
        KafkaConsumer<String, String> consumer = new KafkaConsumer<>(props);
        
        // Subscribe to the topic(s)
        consumer.subscribe(Collections.singletonList("my-topic"));
        
        try {
            while (true) {
                // Poll for new records (this could be done in a batch manner)
                ConsumerRecords<String, String> records = consumer.poll(Duration.ofMillis(100));

                for (ConsumerRecord<String, String> record : records) {
                    // Process each record
                    System.out.printf("Consumed record with key %s and value %s, partition %d, offset %d%n",
                            record.key(), record.value(), record.partition(), record.offset());
                    
                    // Add your event processing logic here
                    processEvent(record);
                    
                    // Manually commit the offset after processing
                    // Commit the offset for this partition and offset
                    consumer.commitSync(Collections.singletonMap(record.partition(), record.offset() + 1));
                }
            }
        } catch (Exception e) {
            e.printStackTrace();
        } finally {
            consumer.close();
        }
    }

    private static void processEvent(ConsumerRecord<String, String> record) {
        // Add your event processing logic here.
        // Ensure that it is idempotent, or check for unique event IDs to prevent duplicate processing.
        System.out.println("Processing event: " + record.value());
    }
}
```

### **Explanation:**
- **Manual Offset Commit (`consumer.commitSync()`)**: After processing each record, we manually commit the offset. This ensures that offsets are only committed once the event has been successfully processed, which avoids losing progress or duplicating events in case of failures.
- **Auto Commit Disabled**: `ENABLE_AUTO_COMMIT_CONFIG` is set to `false` to disable Kafka’s default offset commit behavior.
- **Committing Specific Offsets**: The method `commitSync(Collections.singletonMap(record.partition(), record.offset() + 1))` commits the offset for each partition after processing a message. The `+1` ensures that the next poll will skip the processed message.

### **Kafka Consumer with Transactional Semantics**
If you want to use Kafka’s **exactly-once semantics (EOS)**, here’s a more advanced version using transactions.

First, ensure that your producer and broker are configured for idempotency and transactions.

#### **Consumer Configuration for Exactly-Once Semantics**

```java
props.put(ConsumerConfig.ISOLATION_LEVEL_CONFIG, "read_committed");  // Ensure you only read committed messages
props.put(ConsumerConfig.ENABLE_AUTO_COMMIT_CONFIG, "false");  // Manual offset commit
```

Here’s how you would implement transactions using the Kafka producer and consumer:

```java
import org.apache.kafka.clients.consumer.ConsumerConfig;
import org.apache.kafka.clients.consumer.KafkaConsumer;
import org.apache.kafka.clients.consumer.ConsumerRecords;
import org.apache.kafka.clients.consumer.ConsumerRecord;
import org.apache.kafka.clients.producer.KafkaProducer;
import org.apache.kafka.clients.producer.ProducerConfig;
import org.apache.kafka.clients.producer.ProducerRecord;
import org.apache.kafka.clients.producer.TransactionState;
import java.util.Properties;
import java.time.Duration;
import java.util.Collections;

public class KafkaExactlyOnceConsumer {

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Set consumer properties
        Properties consumerProps = new Properties();
        consumerProps.put(ConsumerConfig.BOOTSTRAP_SERVERS_CONFIG, "localhost:9092");
        consumerProps.put(ConsumerConfig.GROUP_ID_CONFIG, "transactional-consumer-group");
        consumerProps.put(ConsumerConfig.KEY_DESERIALIZER_CLASS_CONFIG, "org.apache.kafka.common.serialization.StringDeserializer");
        consumerProps.put(ConsumerConfig.VALUE_DESERIALIZER_CLASS_CONFIG, "org.apache.kafka.common.serialization.StringDeserializer");
        consumerProps.put(ConsumerConfig.ENABLE_AUTO_COMMIT_CONFIG, "false");
        consumerProps.put(ConsumerConfig.ISOLATION_LEVEL_CONFIG, "read_committed");

        KafkaConsumer<String, String> consumer = new KafkaConsumer<>(consumerProps);
        consumer.subscribe(Collections.singletonList("my-topic"));

        // Set producer properties for exactly-once semantics
        Properties producerProps = new Properties();
        producerProps.put(ProducerConfig.BOOTSTRAP_SERVERS_CONFIG, "localhost:9092");
        producerProps.put(ProducerConfig.KEY_SERIALIZER_CLASS_CONFIG, "org.apache.kafka.common.serialization.StringSerializer");
        producerProps.put(ProducerConfig.VALUE_SERIALIZER_CLASS_CONFIG, "org.apache.kafka.common.serialization.StringSerializer");
        producerProps.put(ProducerConfig.ENABLE_IDEMPOTENCE_CONFIG, "true"); // Idempotent producer
        producerProps.put(ProducerConfig.TRANSACTIONAL_ID_CONFIG, "my-transactional-id"); // Transactional ID for EOS

        KafkaProducer<String, String> producer = new KafkaProducer<>(producerProps);
        producer.initTransactions(); // Initialize the transaction

        try {
            while (true) {
                ConsumerRecords<String, String> records = consumer.poll(Duration.ofMillis(100));

                producer.beginTransaction(); // Begin a transaction
                
                for (ConsumerRecord<String, String> record : records) {
                    // Process the record
                    System.out.printf("Processing record: %s%n", record.value());
                    // Forward the processed message to another topic (example)
                    producer.send(new ProducerRecord<>("output-topic", record.key(), record.value()));
                }

                // Commit the offsets for the consumer group within the transaction
                producer.sendOffsetsToTransaction(consumer.offsetsForTimes(Collections.emptyMap()), "transactional-consumer-group");
                
                producer.commitTransaction(); // Commit the transaction
            }
        } catch (Exception e) {
            producer.abortTransaction(); // In case of failure, abort the transaction
            e.printStackTrace();
        } finally {
            consumer.close();
            producer.close();
        }
    }
}
```

### **Explanation:**
- **Transaction Support**: The `producer.initTransactions()`, `producer.beginTransaction()`, and `producer.commitTransaction()` methods are used to process messages in a transaction.
- **Atomic Offset Commit**: The `sendOffsetsToTransaction()` method ensures that the consumer's offsets are committed within the same transaction, providing exactly-once processing semantics.
- **Transactional ID**: The producer is configured with a unique `transactional.id` to track the transaction.

### Key Takeaways:
1. **Manual Offset Commit**: Provides control to avoid duplicates and ensure offsets are only committed after successful processing.
2. **Transactional Commit**: Guarantees that both the event processing and offset commits are atomic, preventing message reprocessing or loss, even in failure cases.

These examples should give you a solid base to handle offset management effectively. Let me know if you need more details on any part!
